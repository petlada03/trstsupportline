If you’re using Trust Wallet and find yourself stuck—unable to access your assets, confused by a transaction, or unsure about network settings—real help can make all the difference.

In this guide, we’ll explain how to connect with our U.S.-based team, what common wallet issues we can help with, and why calling us can save you time and stress.

Get in touch anytime: **+1-848-279-6613**

Overview
--------

Trust Wallet is widely used for managing crypto assets, but it’s also decentralized by design. That often means there’s no central place to call when things go wrong. That’s where we come in.

We provide reliable, one-on-one phone assistance for wallet-related concerns across the United States. Whether you’re facing access problems or need guidance on network errors or transaction delays, you can count on us.

Why Phone-Based Help Matters
----------------------------

Most wallet apps offer only self-help documentation or community forums. But sometimes, you need to speak to someone directly. 

Here’s what makes our phone line different:

- **Live experts available 24/7**
- **No bots or automated responses**
- **Clear, step-by-step guidance**
- **U.S. support coverage and timezone alignment**
- **Privacy-focused and never asks for your seed phrase**

Call: **+1-848-279-6613**

When to Reach Out
------------------

You should call if you’re experiencing:

- Inability to open or access your wallet
- Assets not displaying after a transfer
- Transactions stuck in pending status
- Accidental transfer to the wrong network
- Concerns about unknown tokens showing up
- Questions about wallet setup, networks, or swaps

Our team is trained to guide you through these issues securely and efficiently.

Common Wallet Issues We Solve
-----------------------------

Access Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Forgotten passcodes, biometric failures, or app crashes can lock you out. We assist with steps to recover or reconnect using your backup—safely and without compromising your data.

Missing Tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You transferred tokens, but they don’t show up? It could be a custom token that needs to be manually added. We’ll help you verify the contract address and make it visible inside your wallet interface.

Stuck Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Network congestion or low gas settings often result in transactions hanging in pending mode. We explain how to cancel, replace, or avoid such issues in the future.

Lost Seed Phrase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although no one can recover a lost seed, we’ll explain how to check your secure backups and avoid misleading “recovery” scams.

Security Concerns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Received unknown tokens or suspect unauthorized activity? We help you identify spam tokens, phishing attempts, and walk you through safety settings.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

**Do you ask for my seed phrase?**

Never. We do not ask for or store your recovery phrase. If anyone asks you for it, they are trying to scam you.

**Is this an official Trust Wallet phone line?**

We provide third-party phone-based help for wallet-related questions and guidance. Trust Wallet does not offer its own customer phone number. We fill that gap responsibly.

**Do I need to pay for support?**

No. Initial calls are free of charge. We may offer advanced services, but basic assistance is free.

**Is it secure to speak over the phone?**

Yes. We never ask for sensitive info. We guide you based on the problem without compromising your privacy.
